Enum - 

-> It is a special data type that consists of a set of pre-defined named values separated by commas. 
-> These named values are also known as elements or enumerators or enum instances. 
-> Since the values in the enum type are constant, you should always represent them in UPPERCASE letters.
-> You can use an Enum type when you need a fixed set of pre-defined constant values that are known at the compile-time itself.
-> Examples can be days of the week, seasons of the year, etc.

-> The following characteristics make enum a ‘special’ class:

	enum constants cannot be overridden 
	enum doesn’t support the creation of objects
	enum can’t extend other classes
	enum can implement interfaces like classes
-> Syntax:
	In Java, to define an Enum type, the ‘enum’ keyword is used rather than ‘class’ or ‘interface’. Mentioned below is the syntax.

         enum Variable_Name { VALUE_1, VALUE_2, VALUE_3, … }
-> Enum in Java can be defined outside or within the class.


DateTimeFormatter:

-> This class is present in java.time.format package.
-> It helps in uniformly parsing and printing the date-time objects in various inbuilt and custom formatting patterns.
-> ofPattern() - it creates a formatter using specified pattern
-> withLocale() - it returns a copy formatter with specified language like ENGLISH, FRENCH, GERMAN etc.
-> parse() - it fully parses the text specified.
-> get() - it returns integer value of specified month.
-> ChronoField - It is an Enum containing set of fields that represents the Month of the year in numbers like Jan - 1, ..., Dec - 12
